Documentation:

Abel Sebastian: PCB code showcasing the complete validation boards and array board is attached as image files in the "Demo" folder as "Setup_1.jpg","Setup_2.jpg" , and "10_setup.jpg", and the various "Frequency_#HZ_triangular_PWM_Blinking.c".

Sohail Manayathara: Digital coded exposure code under the "Demo" folder is contained as the event visualizer in "dv_streaming.py".

Chase Harper: The Python code output under the "Demo" folder contained as the "dv_50ft_10led.py" file, with the "dv_streaming.py" necessary to stream the output.

The entire system as a whole is validated under "404 Demo Videos" as a series of videos showing the system in various dark airgapped conditions, testing the features, and gathering data.

Disregard any files that do not open or are 2 bytes GitHub is glitching some of the files. 

404 Demo Videos:
For operation of the code, choose a sampling rate (33ms default unless you change the dv_streaming.py file sampling rate), the sample area (default 40 for the correct focal length lens), and initialization frames (default 100 for smooth graphs).
