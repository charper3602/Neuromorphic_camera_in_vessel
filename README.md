Documentation:

Abel Sebastian: PCB videos showcasing the complete validation board and breadboard prototype are attached to this readme and labeled for your convenience. 

Sohail Manayathara: Digital coded exposure code is in the "optics_code" folder labeled as the "dv_accumulator.py", the web streaming code is labeled under "webstreaming.py", simulated neuromorphic camera data is in the "videoFile" folder as an "output.mp4" prefix. 

Chase Harper: The Window Forms program is in the "Decoder_app" branch and the relevant code portion for the decoding of the simulated data is under the "Form1.cs" in the "button5_Click()" function, the relevant test data used is under "textFile" folder as the "coordinates.txt" prefix, the file output videos are in the "videoFiles" folder as the "Coordinates_testing.mp4" prefix. 

Disregard any files that do not open or are 2 bytes GitHub is glitching some of the files. 

404 Demo Videos:
For operation of the code, choose a sampling rate (33ms default unless you change the dv_streaming.py file sampling rate), the sample area (default 40 for the correct focal length lens), and initialization frames (default 100 for smooth graphs).
